       <h2>position: relative;</h2>

<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>

<div class="relative">
This div element has position: relative;
</div>
       <h2>position: static;</h2>

<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>

<div class="static">
This div element has position: static;
</div>

<h2>position: fixed;</h2>

<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:</p>

<div class="fixed">
This div element has position: fixed;
</div>
